## How it's made:
<strong> Tech used: </strong> Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars and Openweathermap API

I made this project in order to sharpen my Node and Express knowledge. I also worked with the open API via https://openweathermap.org/. As an engine template, I ended up using  Handlebars for the first time. It looks more like regular HTML, with embedded handlebars expressions in the curly braces {{}}. It was a great learning  experience.
